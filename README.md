## Project Description
1.Speeddetector(toy problem).
The speed detector toy problem involves creating a program or web application that takes as input the speed of a car and outputs a message depending on the speed. Specifically, if the speed is less than 70 km/h, the program should output "Ok". However, if the speed is greater than or equal to 70 km/h, the program should calculate the number of demerit points the driver has received based on the speed and output a message indicating the number of demerit points. In this problem, each 5 km/h above the speed limit (70 km/h) results in one demerit point. If the number of demerit points exceeds 12, the driver's license should be suspended, and the program should output a message indicating this. The goal of the toy problem is to test the ability to write a program that performs basic calculations and conditionally outputs messages based on the result of those calculations.

2.Student Grade Generator
The Student Grade Generator is a toy problem that demonstrates how programming concepts can be used to solve real-world problems. This program prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100, and then uses a set of criteria to assign a corresponding grade. The grades are then displayed to the user in a visually appealing format. This toy problem is a great way to practice working with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and it can be expanded upon to create more complex grading systems or other types of applications.

3.Net-Salary-Calculator-Toy-Problem-(toy problem).
The Net Salary Calculator is a toy problem that involves building a simple program that calculates the net salary of an employee based on their gross salary and tax rate. The program takes two inputs from the user: their gross salary and their tax rate. It then calculates the net salary by subtracting the tax amount from the gross salary. The tax amount is calculated as a percentage of the gross salary. The program then outputs the net salary to the user.
